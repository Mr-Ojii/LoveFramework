# LoveFramework

Originally it was planned to be released as a game, but I gave up because it is difficult to detect files with LÖVE.
However, I made something like a framework, so I made it public.

Did you say you could create a library to search for files in another programming language?
Then I'll make it in a different programming language from the beginning.

Runs on LÖVE 11.3
